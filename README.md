# ðŸŽ„ AdventOfCode ðŸŽ„
Repository with my answers to [AdventOfCode](https://adventofcode.com/). They're not the best possible, but they were the ones I built the fastest.

I plan to do past years as well, and I'm going to keep each branch (2021, 2020) representing each year.

# Status
| Year | Status |
|------|--------|
| 2020 |11 ðŸŒŸ |
| 2021 | 4 ðŸŒŸ |
